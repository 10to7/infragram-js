To do:
=======================
* trigger choose file on upload button click
* auto-start live video on video button click
* make colorization work for live video
* make percentage upload fit in btn (remove word saving)
* run what's in infragrammar field automatically when image is uploaded or video feed begins
* add a "raw" preset
* run infragrammar expression onChange of infragrammar mode
* port to WebGL
* B/R switch... swapts B and R, maybe? but have a "presets" modal which shows options "for blue filters" and "for red filters"
  * filter_switch() - replace "R" -> "X" -> "B"
* "Start by uploading an image source" popover if no localStorage flag

* auto-stretch for webcam NDVI
* add slider back in (advanced tools?)
